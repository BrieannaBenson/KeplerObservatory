# KeplerObservatory

This is simply an issue tracker for the Kepler Observatory mod pack.

If you have an issue while using the Kepler Observatory modpack or server, this is where you go to tell me about it
and see what I'm doing about it.

If you have an issue, please include as much information as possible, including screenshots and crashlogs when relevant.
To share screenshots, upload them to Imgur or similar image hosting site and include a link.
To share crashlogs, put them in PasteBin and include a link.
This will make issue reports quick and concise - easy for you, and easy for me.

"Issues" include:

Bug - things not working as they are intended to work.
Recipe - A recipe is overwritten, broken, or calls for nonexistent items.
Balance - Things are overpowered/underpowered, making the pack or features too easy or too difficult.
Crash - Your game becomes permanently unresponsive and/or closes by itself.
Adjust - Suggest the addition or removal of a mod or aspect of the pack.

Bugs and Crashes will be much harder for me to fix, but are things I will place the most importance on.
If I can reproduce the crash or bug, I'll suggest a solution or workaround, though I cannot guarantee a fix.

Recipe issues will almost invariably be resolved temporarily in-game by me setting up a swapshop on the map.
If the swapshop proves sufficient, I'll probably just leave it at that for the duration of the map, and try
to have it fixed by or before the implementation of any new map(s).

Balance issues are entirely up to my own personal discretion. You're free to use this
issue tracker for specific concerns in this area, but unless it is glaringly problematic, I
probably will only make balance adjustments according to my own preferences.

Adjustment issues regarding the modpack contents are [also] up to my own personal discretion.
I am not likely to [remove] mods unless they damage the pack's balancing or intent.
I am more open to [adding] mods - especially decoration mods and textures - again, unless they break balance or intent.
If I add a mod, I added it because I wanted it, for one reason or another.
If I remove a mod, I did so because I didn't want it, for one reason or another.
